\lettrine[lines=3, findent=3pt, nindent=0pt]{T}{he} original comic book Superman
could leap tall buildings in a single bound. But then he had to come right back
down to Earth—because he didn't fly. It wasn't until the 1940s, when animators
for a new animated series decided it would be too difficult to routinely draw
him bending his knees, that it was decided that Superman could take off into the
air. Readers got to see smooth animation, and a superhero gained a new power.

This sentence has a footnote attached.\footnote{Try writing out a few
	sentences—anything at all. Now take a minute to look at how frequently each
	letter in the alphabet appears.  Chances are you'll see a lot of the letter
	"e." That's because the commonly used vowel appears in around 11 percent of
	all words in the English language, according to Oxford Dictionaries. The
	next most popular letter was "a," which appears in around 8.5 percent of all
	words. The least common letter is "q," which appears in just 0.2 percent of
	words.}
